## Project: Classification of districts of Warsaw in terms of quality of life ine the years 2012 - 2021

The survey of quality-of-life aspects is based on the generally accepted administrative division of the capital city. The zones under study for aspects of quality of life are the qualities of public services, aspects related to infrastructure, a sense of security and the occurrence of dangerous situations in the vicinity of one's place of residence.
In classifying Warsaw's districts, an initial set of 20 diagnostic variables was selected for each district from the years 2012, 2017 and 2021. In selecting the variables, care was taken to ensure that they best reflected the general diagnostic syndrome and showed a universal character for each district. The study used data on neighbourhoods provided by the Warsaw City Hall. Four groups were created for which rankings of Warsaw's districts were made - a general group, a group with families with children, a group for senior citizens and a group for singles. Each group has its own explanatory variables, which have previously been subjected to selection. 

The aim of the survey is to confront Warsaw's neighbourhoods with the qualities of public services, aspects of infrastructure, sense of security and the occurrence of dangerous situations in the vicinity of one's place of residence. In doing so, there is an opportunity to find out the answers to questions such as - in which district is it best to live. The study measured tourist attractiveness using methods of multidimensional comparative analysis including taxonomic methods.

The study will use four measures. The first two measures are linear ordering methods such as the Kukuła synthetic measure, while the second is its iterative counterpart, the
Kukuła iterative synthetic measure. The other two are cluster analysis methods classified as hierarchical methods, i.e. Ward's method and the furthest neighbour method. A more detailed description of these methods can be found in the pdf file

In order to compare the aforementioned methods, we also used a ranking probability measure and a bifurcation-based clustering method. The results are included in the file ranking_comarison.xlsx

The summaries and conclusions of this project are presented on the penultimate page of the pdf document.
