Model: 64.08+6.12X1+239.92X4+-214.32X7
Interpretation of parameter b1: If the population density (X1) increases by 1000 people per km2, the number of recorded crimes per 1000 inhabitants (Y) increases by an average of 6.12 6.12 cases assuming ceteris paribus.
Interpretation of parameter b2: An increase in the poverty level (X4) by 1% results in an increase in recorded crimes per 1,000 inhabitants (Y) by an average of 239.92 cases, assuming ceteris paribus.
Interpretation of parameter b3: An increase in the rate of people aged 60 or over (X7) by 1% causes a decrease in recorded crimes per 1,000 inhabitants (Y) by an average of -214.32 cases, assuming
ceteris paribus.
Interpretation of the standard deviation of residuals (Se): The empirical values of the number of recorded crimes deviate on average by 10.65 from the theoretical values determined on the basis of the model.
Interpretation R^2: 44.31444625414169% of the total variability in the number of recorded crimes was explained by the model.
Interpretation of the multiple correlation coefficient R: Empirical and theoretical values of the number of recorded crimes are correlated at the level of 66.569%
The beta1 and beta2 parameters are statistically significant (P>|t| is less than 0.05 for X1, X4, X7 )

Parameter evaluation errors:
- The b0 rating differs from the beta0 parameter by an average of 16.11
- The b1 rating differs from the beta1 parameter by an average of 3.0
- The b2 rating differs from the beta2 parameter by an average of 57.85
- The b3 rating differs from the beta3 parameter by an average of 67.08

Interpretations of confidence intervals:
- it can be assumed with 95% that the range from 31.67 to 96.5 includes the unknown value of the beta0 parameter
- it can be assumed for 95% that the range from 0.08 to 12.17 includes the unknown value of the beta1 parameter
- it can be assumed with 95% that the range from 123.53 to 356.3 includes the unknown value of the beta2 parameter
- it can be assumed for 95% that the range from -349.28 to -79.36 includes the unknown value of the beta2 parameter

After performing the Shapiro-Wilk test, we find that the residuals are normally distributed.
After running a series test, I find that the residuals are random in nature.
After performing the Durbin-Watson test, we find no autocorrelation.
After carrying out the Goldfeld-Quandt test, we find that they are homoskedastic.
